                    The Techno Trousers, also called the "Wrong Trousers", are a
                    special pair of robot trousers with many properties. They
                    were originally given to Gromit on his birthday by Wallace
                    in The Wrong Trousers, who claimed they were "ex-NASA". The
                    Techno Trousers had the ability to adhere to any solid
                    surface via suction, enabling the wearer to scale the side
                    of a wall. This, however, was not their original purpose.

                    The Moon Rocket was Wallace's latest invention in A Grand
                    Day Out. When Wallace discovers that there is no cheese in
                    the house, he decides that he and Gromit should take a
                    holiday to a place with lots of cheese. After some
                    deliberation he remembers that the moon is supposedly made
                    of cheese and decides to build a rocket. Along with Gromit's
                    help, Wallace builds the Moon Rocket in the basement of 62
                    West Wallaby Street. After much work the orange rocket was
                    complete. The two light the fuse and blast off. <br />

                    During their trip to the moon, Gromit passes the time
                    building a house of cards while Wallace enjoys some toast
                    from the rocket's built-in toaster. They land on the moon,
                    and exit the rocket to explore the surface and enjoy a
                    picnic. <br />

                    When departing from the moon, the Cooker attempts to
                    stow-away in the lower hull of the rocket, but it is blown
                    out of the rocket and accidentally breaks off pieces of the
                    hull during the blast. The robot fashions the left-behind
                    parts of the rocket into a pair of skis which it uses to ski
                    on the moon.
                    <br />

                    Wallace's moon Rocket has not been seen again; however
                    several allusions to it were made in The Wrong Trousers,
                    including a set of wall decorations in the opening shot of
                    the film along with a miniature of the rocket atop Gromit's
                    dresser. These decorations have since been retained in other
                    films and commercials. <br />

                    After a 21-year absence, it was finally seen again in
                    Wallace and Gromit's World of Invention "Reach for the Sky".
                    The rocket is noticeably more worn down (e.g. has black
                    rings around the rivets) but newly updated (according to the
                    Cracking Contraptions Manual book), showing that World of
                    Invention takes place many years after A Grand Day Out. It
                    appears again in the 2021 mobile app Wallace & Gromit: The
                    Big Fix Up and the video game The Grand Getaway.

              <p>
                Well, Gromit, what a day we’ve had! You’d think a simple
                window-cleaning job would be a doddle, but oh no—turned into a
                right kerfuffle, it did! That new tenant at West Wallaby Street,
                Miss Tottington, seemed lovely enough at first. But blimey, that
                feathery fiend Feathers McGraw was back at it again! Disguised
                as a rabbit, of all things! <br />

                The fiend had his beady little eyes set on our Mind-O-Matic—me
                latest invention for humane pest control, don’t you know. Next
                thing I knew, I was strapped to a giant contraption, hurtling
                toward a cheese moon (or at least, it felt like it)! If it
                weren’t for you, lad, I’d have been a goner for sure.
                <br />

                Gromit, old chum, I think we deserve a good strong cuppa and a
                plate of Wensleydale after this one. No more full moons, no more
                giant rabbits, and definitely no more penguins in disguises. At
                least… not for a while.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div id="note_trousers">
              <h1>Monday, Tea Time Chaos</h1>

              <p>
                Gromit, old pal, remind me never to take in a lodger again! At
                first, it seemed a grand idea—renting out the spare room to that
                mysterious chap, Feathers McGraw. A bit quiet, mind you, but I
                thought, Oh, he’s probably just a night owl! Turns out, he
                was—and not just any night owl, but a criminal mastermind!
                <br />

                Before I knew it, he had me fitted with some sort of
                TECHNO-TROUSERS—not for comfy lounging, no sir, but for a jewel
                heist! There I was, helplessly waddling up the walls of the
                museum while Feathers pilfered a priceless diamond. Good thing
                you were on the case, lad! Between your quick thinking and a
                thrilling train chase, we sent that no-good, flightless felon
                packing!
                <br />

                I tell you, Gromit—next time we need some extra cash, we’re
                better off sticking to cheese-related ventures. Speaking of
                which… how about a bit of Wensleydale to celebrate, eh?
              </p>
            </div>

            <div id="note_loaf">
              <h1>Wednesday, Lunchtime Mishap</h1>

              <p>
                Cracking toast, Gromit! I thought our new Bake-O-Matic would
                revolutionize the bread business, but instead, we’ve landed
                ourselves in a right loaf of trouble! That Piella
                Bakewell—famous Bake-Lite Girl, don’t you know—seemed like a
                lovely customer at first. Flattery, sweet words, an interest in
                me buns! But oh, what a mistake that was… <br />

                She wasn’t after bread, lad—she was after revenge! Turns out,
                she’d been eliminating bakers left and right, and we were next
                on her list. Good thing you were onto her, Gromit! Between
                floating away in a giant doughy airship and dodging a rather
                vengeful poodle, I’d say we had our fair share of close shaves.
                <br />

                No more baking, lad—at least not for business. I think we’ll
                stick to eating toast instead of making it for now… Speaking of
                which, pop a couple slices in, would you?
              </p>
            </div>

            <div id="note_grandday">
              <h1>Thursday, A Grand Day Out (Literally!)</h1>

              <p>
                Well, Gromit, I always suspected the moon was made of cheese,
                and now we’ve gone and proved it! Who’d have thought a homemade
                rocket would actually work? I tell you, lad, nothing like a bit
                of elbow grease and a lot of enthusiasm to get a chap into
                space! <br />

                Moon’s a bit different than I expected—crumbly, yet firm, with a
                slight Wensleydale tang. Very satisfying. But the real surprise
                was that mechanical caretaker fellow! Didn’t seem too pleased
                with our picnic, did he? Kept glaring at us like a disgruntled
                shopkeeper at closing time! When he tried to blast off with our
                rocket, well… that was a bit of a close one!
                <br />

                All in all, not a bad trip—though I think next time, we’ll get
                our cheese from the shop down the road. Less risk of being
                chased by an angry robot, don’t you think?
              </p>
            </div>

              <h1>Friday, A Woolly Predicament</h1>

              <p>
                Well, lad, today was supposed to be a quiet one—just us, a nice
                cup of tea, and perhaps a bit of knitting. But no, someone had
                to go and get us tangled up in sheep-rustling shenanigans! That
                new dog in town, Preston—right shady character, that one. As it
                turns out, he was running a full-blown sheepnapping operation!
                <br />

                Not only that, but the cad tried to turn our new woolly friend
                Shaun into dog food! Imagine that! Good thing we had that
                Knit-O-Matic—even if it did get a bit overenthusiastic with the
                shearing process. Between high-speed chases, mechanical
                malfunctions, and one very flustered villain, I’d say we just
                about saved the day!
                <br />

                Oh, and we’ve gained a permanent house guest, it seems. Shaun’s
                made himself right at home. Best get some extra biscuits, eh?
